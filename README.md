# credit-risk-classification

## Notes
In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## Summary (also included in MD file.)
The Logistic Regression model performed exceptionally well in predicting both healthy and high-risk loans. It achieved high accuracy and demonstrated high precision and recall for both classes. The model's performance is crucial for this problem as it is equally important to correctly identify both healthy and high-risk loans to manage the lending risk effectively.

Considering the high performance and interpretability of the Logistic Regression model, it is recommended for deployment in practical lending scenarios. However, it's essential to continuously monitor and update the model as the lending landscape evolves.
